        <h2 class="text-centre">My Story</h2>
        <section class="founder">
            <p class="story">Zen Mind began as a small passion project in Lancaster, inspired by my own journey with
                mental
                health.
                After struggling with anxiety and depression for several years, I realised how challenging it could
                be
                to find trustworthy information and support. In the process of seeking help, I encountered many
                individuals who felt isolated, misunderstood, and unsure where to turn.<br><br><br>
                Motivated by these experiences, I decided to create a platform that would be more than just a source
                of
                information. I wanted to build a community where people could share their stories, connect with one
                another, and access resources that empower them to take charge of their mental well-being. From
                those
                early days, Zen Mind has grown into a supportive network of mental health advocates, professionals,
                and
                individuals united by the common goal of promoting mental wellness and breaking the stigma around
                mental
                health.<br><br><br>
                — John Smith, Founder of Zen Mind</p>
