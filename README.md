## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

### Primary Goal

Zen Mind is a mental health awareness platform and community.

They required a clean and calming website which reflects the organisation’s mission of providing reliable information and support to individuals’ mental health support.

### Visitor Goals

Zen Mind’s visitors include people from diverse backgrounds and have varying levels of familiarity with mental health topics.

The site was designed to be user-friendly and have a minimalistic theme to it so that users could easily navigate through the site and access mental health resources. It was designed to be responsive, with the content adjusting to desktop and mobile devices.

### First Time Visitor

A user can access each page of the site through the navigation bar, which includes links to all the pages.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used ChatGPT to generate a primary text colour and a background colour for my website. My goal was to create a calming and aesthetic theme that would go well with a site focused on mental health awareness. 

I then used Adobe to test out other colour themes and generate the following colour palette:

[![colour-palette.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T1S77KFd/colour-palette.png)](https://postimg.cc/64rfTpBg)

The theme needed to meet web accessibility standards. WCAG defines a minimum colour contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. I tested the contrast ratio using Adobe’s colour contrast checker tool, which gave me a contrast ratio of 10.4:1, which ensured good readability for visually impaired individuals.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import the fonts 'Lato' and 'Karla'. Lato and Karla are both sans-serif fonts, and are ones that have been used widely as a font pairing. I used Karla for headings, and Lato for the main body of text on my website.

## Future Features

- For future development, I would like to create a responsive contact form for the Contact Us page.
- I would also add a well being tips section, and a get help section which would have a list of useful contacts that users could reach out to. 
- Another cool feature could be a mental health quiz for users to fill out, which would display information according to their responses or score
