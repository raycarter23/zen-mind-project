            <h2>Understanding Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Mental health is an integral part of our overall well-being. It includes our emotional, psychological,
                and social well-being, affecting how we think, feel, and act. It also determines how we handle stress,
                relate to others, and make choices.</p>
            <p>Taking care of our mental health should be a priority at every stage of life, from childhood and
                adolescence through adulthood. This section provides an introduction to what mental health is, why it’s
                important, and how it differs from mental illness.</p>

                    <h3>What is Mental Health?</h3>
                    <p>Mental health refers to our cognitive, behavioural, and emotional well-being. It’s more than just
                        the absence of mental disorders. Good mental health helps us realize our full potential, cope
                        with the stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to our communities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining positive mental health is crucial for leading a balanced and fulfilling life. Good
                        mental health enables us to build strong relationships, work more efficiently, and adapt to
                        change. It’s not only about preventing or managing mental illnesses but also about enhancing our
                        well-being and achieving emotional resilience.</p>

                    <h3>Mental Health vs. Mental Illness</h3>
                    <p>It’s important to distinguish between mental health and mental illness. Everyone has mental
                        health, just like everyone has physical health. Mental illness, on the other hand, refers to a
                        range of mental health conditions that affect mood, thinking, and behaviour. Conditions such as
                        depression, anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorder are considered mental illnesses. Seeking
                        help when facing such challenges is a vital step toward recovery and wellness.</p>
